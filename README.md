# Computer Vision - Study Repository

>This repository documents the learning journey and practical exercises of the **Computer Vision** course at (PPGMCS)[] - Unimontes (2025), taught by Prof. Antônio Wilson Vieira.

## 📚 Objectives

- Understand the foundations of image formation and color models
- Explore practical applications of computer vision
- Develop hands-on skills using Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV
- Apply knowledge in a final project with real-world relevance
